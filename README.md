# Sort the Colored Balls
This is a simple command line mini game I've created for the introduction to programming class. In this game, player tries to sort out the balls in tubes by their colors. 

## Rules of the Game
1. Minimum number of tubes is 5. Player can’t play with less than 5 tubes.
2. Since the program is a console-based application, the colors of the balls inside the
tubes will be represented with letters.
3. Tubes can’t contain more than a specific number of balls.
4. The balls can’t be moved to a tube that is full.
5. Only the ball on top can be moved.
6. The balls can’t be moved if there is a different colored ball underneath.
7. There should be a counter that keeps the number of moves made by the player.
8. The game ends when each tube only contains balls which have the same color.

## Notes
Although it is working fine, I'm not confident to tell that this was a well-written program. It can be improved a lot in both performance & memory management-wise. But since this was a project to develop algorithm building skills, my main focus was to create a functioning game, and I didn't consider other things. So I'm pretty sure there are better and smarter approaches out there than what I did here.

There's a project report I wrote (to deliver to my instructor) that can be found in the visual studio solution folder, which describes the flow of the program and the reasoning behind it, better.
